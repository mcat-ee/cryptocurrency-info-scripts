# cryptocurrency-info-scripts

Basic scripts for scraping market data about cryptocurrencies

# Notes

- Currently the scripts included are only intended for use with Ethereum markets. Many of the sell-price functions can be modified for other currencies.

- While this scrapes the publically-listed sell-prices, attention should be paid to the order book of whatever market you are investigating.


# TODO

- Refactor the included calls, there's a significant volume of repeated code.
